# Alzheimer's Disease Detection(Classification) Using CNN

This project aims to classify the stages of Alzheimer's Disease using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It leverages deep learning techniques to detect Alzheimer's stages from brain MRI images.

##  Project Overview

Alzheimer's Disease progresses through multiple stages, and early detection is critical. This notebook builds a CNN-based image classification model to classify brain MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer's Disease.

##  Dataset

The dataset used contains MRI images of subjects classified into four categories:
- Non-Demented
- Very Mild Demented
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented

##  Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Custom CNN model architecture using TensorFlow and Keras
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of training performance
- Classification report and confusion matrix

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

##  Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

##  Results

The model achieves high classification accuracy on the validation dataset and performs well in detecting the stages of Alzheimer’s Disease.
