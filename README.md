# Alzheimer's Disease Classification Using CNN

This project aims to classify the stages of Alzheimer's Disease using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It leverages deep learning techniques to detect Alzheimer's stages from brain MRI images.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Alzheimer's Disease progresses through multiple stages, and early detection is critical. This notebook builds a CNN-based image classification model to classify brain MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer's Disease.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains MRI images of subjects classified into four categories:
- Non-Demented
- Very Mild Demented
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Custom CNN model architecture using TensorFlow and Keras
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of training performance
- Classification report and confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
